Wily version 0.01
=================


This module provides an interface to the Wily text editor. For
information about the Wily text editor see:

http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~oz/wily/

A very low level interface is provided in Wily::Message and Wily::Connect,
equivalent to the msg.h interface that comes with wily. A higher level
wrapper around those in the form of Wily::RPC is also provided, and is
equivalent to the rpc.h interface that comes with wily.

Finally, in Wily.pm an even higher level wrapper around Wily::RPC is
provided.

A quick example of using the module is implementing $EDITOR, ie. a program
that opens the file specified on the command line in wily and waits for the
user to close that wily window before exiting:

#!/usr/bin/perl 
use warnings;
use strict;
use Cwd 'abs_path';

use Wily;
use Wily::Message;

die "Usage: $0 filename\n" unless @ARGV;

# connect to wily
my $wily = Wily->new();

# open the file in a window and activate the dirty indicator and backups
my $win = $wily->win(abs_path($ARGV[0]), 1);

# set a callback to exit if we the window is destroyed
$win->set_callback(Wily::Message::WEdestroy, sub {exit(0)});

# register to receive notification if the window is destroyed
$win->attach(Wily::Message::WEdestroy);

# loop waiting for a destroy notification (or for wily to drop out connection)
$wily->event_loop();
